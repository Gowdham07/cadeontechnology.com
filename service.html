	<p>Computer hardware servicing refers to doing repairs and maintenance on the physical components of a computer and its peripherals, including fans, hard drives, keyboards and printers. It differs from software-related maintenance, which deals with the programs running on a computer, including eliminating malware, installing new software and updating programs for users, though some people are skilled at both.</p>
