	<p>Mobile apps generate additional revenues for a company in three key ways:firstly,because most people carry a mobile device,apps encourage repeat orders from customers on the go.The sheer simplicity and convenience of apps versus going to a website makes it easier for consumers to buy. Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones.These software applications are designed to run on mobile devices, such as a smartphone or tablet computer. These applications can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered as web applications using server-side or client-side processing. </p>
