	<p>Color printer is available here and also A2 building sheet printer also available And just available onoffice equipment including scanners, printers, and multifunction systems that scan, print, copy, email and fax. we are required to show this valor and dip our legs in the huge sea of business industry. There are multiple options available for us to choose from as to which business we should start be it high or low in investment. One of the great ideas is a Printing shop. The shops most of us take for granted but they are one important service that keeps the life of any office-goer or a student easy. In our country, not many people can afford to buy premium grade printers as they are expensive and even the maintenance cost is high and these shops that are always around the corner in form of small kiosks help us no matter what. Be it any school project, making a copy of notes for your college finals, huge bundles of circulars that are to be distributed in your office, or be it printing of big banners or architectural plans sheet. It is one of the best ideas to start up small scale business. You sure have to work hard but the investment is low and revenue is comparatively very high. But there are few necessities that we must know to avoid landing into any trouble. </p>
